A FILE FILTER READS AN INPUT FILE, TRANSFORMS IT IN SOME WAY, AND WRITES THE RESULTS TO AN OUTPUT FILE. WRITE AN ABSTRACT FILE FILTER CLASS THAT DEFINES A PURE VIRTUAL FUNCTION FOR TRANSFORMING A CHARACTER. 

CREATE ONE SUBCLASS OF YOUR FILE FILTER CLASS THAT PERFORMS ENCRYPTION, ANOTHER THAT TRANSFORMS A FILE TO ALL UPPERCASE, AND ANOTHER THAT CREATES AN UNCHANGED COPY OF THE ORIGINAL FILE.
