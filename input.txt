A file filter reads an input file, transforms it in some way, and writes the results to an output file. Write an abstract file filter class that defines a pure virtual function for transforming a character. 

Create one subclass of your file filter class that performs encryption, another that transforms a file to all uppercase, and another that creates an unchanged copy of the original file.
